# TASK

## You work for the city of Seattle. To achieve its goal of a carbon-neutral city in 2050, your team is taking a close interest in emissions from non-residential buildings. For this, careful records were made by your agents in 2015 and 2016.However, these surveys are expensive to obtain, and from those already done, you want to try to predict the emissions of buildings whoseemissionshave not yet been measured.Two measures interest you: CO2 emissions and total energy consumption. You also want to evaluate the interest in the emission prediction of the ENERGYSTAR Score(which is complicated to calculate)with the approach currently used by your team.
